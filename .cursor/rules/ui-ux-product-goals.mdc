# UI/UX Product Goals

## Product Vision

The UI must be **user-friendly and easy to understand** for musicians. Prioritize clarity, discoverability, and minimal cognitive load. Every screen should feel intuitive at a glance.

## Modern UX Standards

Follow best practices:

- Clear visual hierarchy and consistent patterns
- Responsive design (mobile-first for practice and live use)
- Accessible controls (labels, focus states, touch targets)
- Smooth transitions and feedback on interactions
- Dark mode support for low-light environments

## Competitive Benchmark

**Goal: Do better than Ultimate Guitar** (https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/)

Aim to outperform in UX:

- Fewer distractions (no intrusive ads or clutter)
- Simpler, faster navigation
- Streamlined workflows (add song, find song, transpose, play)
- Mobile-first experience
- Cleaner song viewer with readable chords and lyrics
- Faster page loads and interactions

## Principles Checklist

When designing or editing UI components:

- Readable typography (font size, line height, contrast)
- Minimal cognitive load (fewer options per screen, clear primary actions)
- Clear affordances (buttons look clickable, controls are self-explanatory)
- Touch-friendly on mobile (min 44px targets, spacing for fingers)
- Dark mode variants for all surfaces and text
- Consistent with existing patterns (see `ui-design-toolsbar.mdc` for styling)
